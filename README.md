Local Creativity
============

Local Creativity is a modification of an open source Local Market app powered by Meteor and made by [Percolate Studio](http://percolatestudio.com). This extension of Local Market was modified by Arts &amp; Ideas studio:

  - Using a sample database to generate lists and items
  - Integrating OAUTH with Meteor's accounts-ui package
  - Cordova integration to use device phone and GPS
  - Mobile UI & UX

===========

In addition to modifying the design and adding to the functionality, Arts &amp; Ideas is integrating
  – Google Spreadsheets -> MongoDB through Zapier
  – Stripe Checkout
  – Democracy OS Voting
  – Famono for (some) Famous 3D physics UI additions
  – Location/maps

===========

The result will be an opensource, public domain app which allows anyone to publish, discover, fund and vote on local creativity and creative initiatives.
